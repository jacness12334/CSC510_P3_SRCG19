Project 1a findings

## Exact prompt

```text
You are a market analyst. Our product, in one paragraph:

WolfBite is a cross-platform Flutter/Firebase shopping assistant for WIC
participants. It lets authenticated shoppers identify products through barcode
scanning or manual UPC entry, review nutrition information, compare healthier
alternatives, manage a basket against WIC category allowances, import products
recognized from receipts, review benefit balances, and generate a QR-based
checkout handoff. Project 1a found that the application has useful shopping and
benefit-management features but also has inconsistent behavior around
eligibility, shopper-paid overflow, missing nutrition data, receipt importing,
persistence failures, and checkout interoperability.

Hard constraint: our four-student team has one month to build AND test the new
product, with approximately ten hours per student per week.

List the ten closest competing products. Output a table: product | who uses
it | main strength | main weakness | price | evidence URL.

Rules: no invented products. If you are not sure a product exists, leave it
out. If you cannot support a claim, write "unknown" -- do not fill the cell
with something plausible.

## Complete raw response

| Product | Who uses it | Main strength | Main weakness | Price | Evidence URL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WICShopper | WIC participants in supported state and tribal programs | Broad WIC shopping coverage with real-time benefit balances and benefit-aware barcode scanning; JPMA also documents online-ordering and delivery deployments | It does not work outside supported WIC programs, and capabilities vary by agency | Free | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wicshopper/id614569159 |
| Bnft | SNAP and WIC cardholders in supported programs, including North Carolina and Illinois WIC | Combines real-time balances, transaction/card management, store location, and a WIC scanner that checks both approval and available benefits | The current listing documents limited WIC-program availability | Free | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bnft/id1286864895 |

| WIC2Go | New York WIC participants, plus users searching for WIC stores, clinics, and approved foods | Offers barcode checks, benefits and expiration information, appointments, and WIC location search | New York now directs people to ebtEDGE and describes WIC2Go as available to current users only, making it a legacy competitor | Free | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wic2go/id1374515952 |

The recurring documented weakness is geographic and program fragmentation:
many otherwise close rivals work only for one state or a defined set of WIC
agencies. This table does **not** prove that all rivals lack WolfBite's
nutrition comparison, receipt-image import, or QR handoff. A feature missing
from a cited summary is not proof that the product lacks it; those possible
market-gap claims require a separate, deeper check.

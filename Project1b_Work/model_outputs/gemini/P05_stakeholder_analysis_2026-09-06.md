## Exact prompt

```text
You are a requirements engineer performing stakeholder analysis.

Our product is WolfBite, a cross-platform Flutter/Firebase shopping assistant
for WIC participants. It supports barcode or manual UPC identification,
nutrition information, healthier-alternative comparison, a basket tied to WIC
category allowances, receipt-product recognition, benefit balances, and a
QR-based checkout handoff. Project 1a found risks involving eligibility,
missing nutrition data, benefit state, persistence, receipt import, and
checkout interoperability.

Our stakeholders so far are: WIC shopper, WIC clinic staff, and WIC program
administrator.

That list is lazy. Extend it. Consider: who pays, who profits, who is harmed,
who is ignored, who regulates, who maintains this at 3 a.m., who gets sued when
it fails, and whose job changes because it exists.

For each new stakeholder, output a table with: stakeholder | relationship to
the product | what they fear | one design decision that would win them over |
how the four-student team could verify that decision in one month.

Hard constraint: our four-student team has one month to build AND test the new
product, with approximately ten hours per student per week.

Rules: do not rename the three existing stakeholders and present them as new.
Do not assume access to live WIC, EBT, retailer, or government systems. Mark
design decisions that would require external approval or integration, and
prefer a testable one-month slice when the full solution is too large.

## Complete raw response

| stakeholder | relationship to the product | what they fear | one design decision that would win them over | how the four-student team could verify that decision in one month |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Grocery Store Cashier | Must process WIC transactions and handle shopper confusion when the app and register disagree | The app says an item is approved, but the register rejects it, causing a long line and an angry customer | Explicit UI warning differentiating "WIC Eligible generally" from "Covered by YOUR current balance" | Build a mock checkout flow demonstrating this UI warning and test it with a simulated out-of-balance item |
| WolfBite On-Call Developer | Maintains the Flutter/Firebase app in production and responds to outages | Silent failures or vague user complaints ("scanner broke") that are impossible to reproduce without context | A "Send Debug Logs" button that securely packages recent app state and errors | Implement a basic in-memory action logger and Firebase upload function, testing that a simulated error correctly sends the log |
| EBT Processor / State Contractor | Regulates and processes the actual financial transactions (requires external integration) | The app facilitates fraudulent purchases or overloads their systems with excessive balance-check API calls | Implement strict client-side rate limiting and caching for benefit balance checks (requires external approval for live API integration) | Build and test a mocked EBT API client that enforces a 5-minute cache on balance checks, verifying it blocks excessive requests |
| Product Manufacturer | Wants their WIC-approved products to be correctly identified to maintain sales | Their newly approved product is missing from the app's database, leading shoppers to buy competitors' products | A "Report Missing Product" form allowing users to submit UPCs and photos for manual review | Implement the UI for the submission form and the backend Firebase storage, writing a test confirming data is stored correctly |

## Exact prompt

```text
Our product:

WolfBite is a cross-platform Flutter/Firebase shopping assistant for WIC
participants. It lets authenticated shoppers identify products through barcode
scanning or manual UPC entry, review nutrition information, compare healthier
alternatives, manage a basket against WIC category allowances, import products
recognized from receipts, review benefit balances, and generate a QR-based
checkout handoff. Project 1a found that the application has useful shopping and
benefit-management features but also has inconsistent behavior around
eligibility, shopper-paid overflow, missing nutrition data, receipt importing,
persistence failures, and checkout interoperability.

Propose three versions: SAFE (obvious next step), BOLD (a real bet), and
WILD (probably wrong, but instructive). For each:
- Elevator pitch, two sentences.
- What four students could build AND test of it in one month.
- The biggest risk.
- The kill signal: "we abandon this version if we see ___."

Do not blend them into one compromise. Keep the three futures distinct.

## Complete raw response

### SAFE Version
- **Elevator pitch:** WolfBite 1.1 focuses purely on stabilizing the core shopping experience by fixing the scanner, nutrition data, and persistence bugs identified in Project 1a. We will remove the unreliable receipt OCR and checkout handoff features to ensure the remaining app is robust.
- **What four students could build AND test of it in one month:** Fix the eligibility logic, integrate a reliable nutrition data source, implement robust local caching for persistence, and write comprehensive exception-path tests for these core features.
- **The biggest risk:** The app becomes too basic and fails to differentiate itself from existing competitors, offering no compelling reason for users to adopt it.
- **The kill signal:** we abandon this version if we see that fixing the existing bugs requires rebuilding the entire architecture from scratch, blowing past the one-month budget.

### BOLD Version
- **Elevator pitch:** WolfBite Pivot focuses entirely on the "Smart Checkout and Receipt" experience, becoming a companion app rather than a full shopping assistant. It specializes in OCR receipt analysis to automatically audit past purchases against WIC allowances and predicts future shopping lists.
- **What four students could build AND test of it in one month:** A highly tuned OCR pipeline for grocery receipts, a categorization engine that matches receipt text to WIC categories, and a UI to display purchase history and allowance usage.
- **The biggest risk:** Grocery receipt formats are too varied and low-quality for our OCR to achieve the necessary accuracy within a one-month timeframe.
- **The kill signal:** we abandon this version if we see OCR accuracy on standard receipts remains below 80% after two weeks of tuning.

### WILD Version
- **Elevator pitch:** WolfBite Social is a community-driven WIC alternative-finding platform where users crowd-source and vote on the best WIC-eligible product substitutions at specific local stores. It gamifies finding healthy, available alternatives when preferred items are out of stock.
- **What four students could build AND test of it in one month:** A location-based feed of user-submitted product alternatives, upvote/downvote mechanics, and a basic store-inventory tagging system backed by Firebase.
- **The biggest risk:** The platform suffers from the "empty restaurant" problem; without a massive initial user base, there won't be enough data to make the app useful to early adopters.
- **The kill signal:** we abandon this version if we see that we cannot seed the database with enough accurate, localized alternatives to make a compelling demo for even one grocery store.

## Exact prompt

```text
You are a requirements and market-research analyst.

Below are 12 real issue observations from ten independent reviewers of three
products selected from our Prompt 1 rival list: WICShopper, Bnft, and myWIC
Mosaic. Each record includes a direct source and a limitation note. Treat two
issues from the same review as one independent report when discussing how many
users reported a theme. Do not treat an old or resolved report as a confirmed
current defect.

| ID | Rival product | Complaint excerpt | Source URL | Source type | Date accessed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C01 | WICShopper | "doesn't always show everything that's available" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wicshopper/id614569159?platform=iphone&see-all=reviews | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Scanner coverage complaint; listing displays the review as May 23 without a year. Self-reported, so it establishes user experience rather than root cause. |
| C02 | WICShopper | "approved that isn't actually approved" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wicshopper/id614569159?platform=iphone&see-all=reviews | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Reviewer describes a package-size mismatch at checkout; listing displays May 4 without a year. |
| C03 | WICShopper | "my benefits have expired" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wicshopper/id614569159?platform=iphone&see-all=reviews | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Reviewer reports an incorrect beginning-of-month status until the card is used; listing displays June 1 without a year. |
| C04 | WICShopper | "item descriptions are generic" | https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jpma.EBTShopper | Google Play review | 2026-09-03 | Dated 2026-06-29; reviewer says poor search descriptions increase in-store shopping time. |
| C05 | Bnft | "logs me out multiple times" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bnft/id1286864895 | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | The listing displays March 22 without a year. Same review as C06; count it as one independent reviewer when measuring frequency. |
| C06 | Bnft | "unknown error please try again" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bnft/id1286864895 | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Scanner failure reported in the C05 review after update/reinstall troubleshooting. |
| C07 | Bnft | "log in sometimes up to three times" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bnft/id1286864895 | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Review dated 2025-11-07 describes repeated login plus text verification during one shopping trip. |
| C08 | Bnft | "Cannot update phone number" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bnft/id1286864895 | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Review dated 2023-08-29 describes account lockout after loss of the old number; older report with no current resolution established. |
| C09 | myWIC Mosaic | "scanner stopped working" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mywic-mosaic/id1560485314 | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Review dated 2025-08-27 reports that reinstalling restored the scanner; this is a workaround, not proof of a current universal failure. |
| C10 | myWIC Mosaic | "eligible items comes back ineligible" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mywic-mosaic/id1560485314 | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Updated 2024-06-06 review says the scanner was repaired after roughly two months, so this incident is marked resolved. |
| C11 | myWIC Mosaic | "schedule Wic appointments ... not an available option" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mywic-mosaic/id1560485314 | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Review dated 2025-01-30; may depend on clinic/program configuration rather than only the app. |
| C12 | myWIC Mosaic | "none of them will register" | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mywic-mosaic/id1560485314 | Apple App Store review | 2026-09-03 | Same C11 reviewer reports failed baby/pregnancy status changes. Treat C11 and C12 as one independent reviewer in frequency claims. |

Corpus limitations:

- These are 12 issue observations from ten independent reviewers, not 12
  independent people.
- App-store reviews are direct evidence that users reported a problem, but do
  not by themselves prove the technical cause or current prevalence.
- C08 is older, C10 was later reported fixed, and C09 has a reinstall
  workaround. They remain useful history but must not be described as confirmed
  current defects.
- Reviews shown without a year are recorded exactly that way rather than
  assigning a guessed year.

Cluster these complaints into themes. Rank the themes by frequency times
severity. For each theme: quote one complaint verbatim as evidence, and say
whether any current product has fixed it. The unfixed themes are our
opportunity list.

Output one table with: rank | theme | complaint IDs | independent reports |
severity (1--3) | frequency-times-severity score | short verbatim evidence |
fixed, partial, not fixed, or unknown | reasoning. Then provide a numbered
opportunity list.

Hard constraint: our four-student team has one month to build AND test the new
product, with approximately ten hours per student per week.

Rules: use only the supplied corpus and its linked evidence. Do not invent
complaints, prevalence, product features, or fixes. Clearly distinguish a
complaint-derived opportunity from a verified market gap.

## Complete raw response

| rank | theme | complaint IDs | independent reports | severity (1--3) | frequency-times-severity score | short verbatim evidence | fixed, partial, not fixed, or unknown | reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scanner and Database Inaccuracy | C01, C02, C04, C06, C09, C10 | 6 | 3 | 18 | "doesn't always show everything that's available" | partial | Found across WICShopper, Bnft, and myWIC; C10 was later reported fixed and C09 has a reinstall workaround, but the corpus provides no evidence about whether C01/C02/C04/C06 are currently fixed. |
| 2 | Login and Authentication Failures | C05, C07 | 2 | 3 | 6 | "logs me out multiple times" | unknown | Two independent reports indicate repeated logouts/re-login; the corpus does not establish whether a current app version has fixed this. |
| 3 | Profile Update Lockout | C08 | 1 | 3 | 3 | "Cannot update phone number" | unknown | Older 2023 Bnft report with no confirmed fix. |
| 4 | Benefit State Inaccuracy | C03 | 1 | 2 | 2 | "my benefits have expired" | unknown | WICShopper report with no resolution evidence. |
| 5 | Missing Configuration/Features | C11, C12 | 1 | 2 | 2 | "none of them will register" | unknown | myWIC Mosaic report, potentially a clinic config issue rather than app defect. |

### Opportunity List

1. **Reliable, offline-capable scanner with an accurate product database:** Based on the high frequency of scanner complaints, building a scanner that does not fail with "unknown error" and accurately reflects eligible package sizes is a significant opportunity.
2. **Stable authentication that persists seamlessly during a shopping trip:** Users are frustrated by repeated logouts while in the store; providing a persistent session would improve the shopping experience.
3. **Self-service profile recovery and update mechanisms:** Addressing the inability to update a phone number would solve a severe account lockout scenario.
4. **Accurate real-time benefit balance synchronization:** Ensuring benefit status accurately reflects the beginning-of-month state before the card is used would reduce user confusion.
5. **Clear error handling and messaging when features are disabled:** If features like appointment scheduling are disabled by clinic configuration, the app should explain this rather than silently failing to register actions.
